## What is E-Melder-GUI
E-Melder-GUI is an alternative application to sign up Judoka for competitions, if the organizer of an event uses the E-Melder software by DATASERVICE Software.
It is designed to have a better UX than the official application and to be, different from the official application, FOSS.
